This could be used only one time, it's very helpful \r\n* On github: go to settings  \r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19669263/eda93742-9a2b-11e6-8ff7-db2ab82e1a3b.png)\r\n* click on SSH \r\n* after clicking on ssh key you'll see that there is a \"key\" needed  \r\n  * you will need to go to c9 and get a key   \r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19669403/0fb7ef58-9a2d-11e6-9804-733185d656aa.png)\r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19668387/863abe92-9a25-11e6-8c70-e46f635bba80.png)\r\n* copy and paste the key onto github\r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19671767/1ec54132-9a3f-11e6-9ddf-88b7b1e0404c.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Repository Setup\r\n### Making a first-repo    \r\nOn github you'll need to...\r\n* Make a file called first-repo  \r\n   * mkdir makes a new directory  \r\n* cd into first-repo \r\n  * always change directory to the new file \r\n* git init \r\n  * never initialize on workspace  \r\n* touch README.md  \r\n  * touch could be used within the directory   \r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19785125/40874454-9c66-11e6-9036-d76dc4d0d0a6.png)\r\n* type something on the file! \r\n  * ex: \"This is my first repo!!\"  \r\n* After you're done you will need to use git add\r\n  *One of the important commands you'll need to use\r\n* Afterwards git commit -m \"message\"\r\n  * It is always important to add a message, this would be able to show what you have added/edited\r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19785992/c7eb8092-9c69-11e6-9894-9d3ebbfefad2.png)\r\n* Git push\r\n  * don't push unless you already made a repo on c9\r\n * There you go! you made your first repo :)  \r\nOn cloud9 you'll need to...  \r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19785655/3b30fe30-9c68-11e6-8d26-db7facc2550a.png)\r\n * The names have to match  \r\n * After making the repository, you'll have to copy each line below on github: \r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19785636/1c8b0c28-9c68-11e6-8034-27b504728d12.png)\r\n![screenshot](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/15129114/19785997/cd699356-9c69-11e6-9941-d7deac92573b.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n## Workflow & Commands\r\n### These lists of commands will be helpful on github \r\n\r\n*`git init`  \r\n  * This command initializes git in directory which is now called a repository. This can only happen once at the beginning\r\n\r\n*`mkdir`  \r\n  * makes a file in the workspace  \r\n\r\n*`cd`  \r\n  * Allows to change directory    \r\n\r\n*`git add file`  \r\n  * adds file to the stage   \r\n    \r\n*`git commit -m \"message\"`  \r\n  * takes a snapshot of the current files that are on the stage, the messag eshould also state what has been edited on the file    \r\n\r\n*`git status`  \r\n  * One helpful tool/command that shows current files which are commited   \r\n\r\n*`git push`  \r\n  * stores code into the cloud  ",
